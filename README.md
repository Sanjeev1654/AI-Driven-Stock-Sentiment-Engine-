# AI-Driven Stock Sentiment Engine

This project implements an **AI-powered sentiment analysis engine** for financial markets.  
It processes financial news and stock-related text data to classify sentiment (positive/negative) and can be used for **quantitative trading signals** or **market risk analysis**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Collects and preprocesses stock-related text (news, social media, transcripts).  
- Uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for text cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal.  
- Trains a **deep learning model (LSTM)** for sentiment classification.  
- Evaluates predictions using accuracy and loss metrics.  
- Designed to integrate into **quant trading pipelines** as a sentiment-driven signal generator.

## 📊 AI & Statistical Concepts Used
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – tokenization, stopword removal, text vectorization.  
- **Word Embeddings** – numerical representation of words for deep learning.  
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM)** – model sequential dependencies in financial text.  
- **Sentiment Classification** – binary classification (positive vs negative).  
- **Model Evaluation** – accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, validation performance.
