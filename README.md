üìù Sentiment Analysis Engine for Financial News & Stocks
 General Idea of the Project

Implements a sentiment analysis engine to classify text as positive or negative.

Focuses on financial news and stock-related text to help understand market sentiment.

Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text:
Removing punctuation
Removing stopwords
Tokenization (splitting text into words)
Builds a deep learning model with:
Embedding layer for word vector representation
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sequence learning
Dense layers for classification
Outputs predictions that can be used in trading strategies or market research.
